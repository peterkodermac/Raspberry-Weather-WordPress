This plugin displays data recorded by your weather station. It connects to your database and draws a nice line graph. 

== Description ==

By following the tutorials on www.raspberryweather.com you can use your Raspberry Pi to create **your own weather station**. When the initial steps are completed,
you can display the readings in a nice graph. It connects to the Wordpress database and draws a graph that contains temperature and humidity readings. The graph
is customizable. 

You can decide if you want to display the temperature and humidity or just temperature or humidity. The graph displays the data from the date you
want - today, yesterday or a specific date. This plugin adds a new icon to your kitchen sink. By clicking on it, a shortcode is generated and pasted in your post.

If you just want to take a look at how this plugin looks, you can. It will display some dummy data to show you how everything looks like.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the package to */wp-content/plugins directory*
2. Activate the plugin through "Plugins" menu in Wordpress
3. Create the graph by clicking the icon on kitchen sink
4. Optionally modify the shortcode that is displayed
